# Test Text Selection System

## Changes Made

✅ **Removed the overlay PageCard preview** - The system no longer shows a preview of the PageCard in the overlay after generating it.

✅ **Focuses on direct markdown editing** - When users select text and click "Explain", the system:
1. Generates a contextual PageCard using the OpenAI API
2. Creates proper MDX markup for the PageCard
3. Embeds it directly into the markdown content near the selected text
4. Saves the updated content to Firebase automatically

✅ **Cleaner user experience** - The overlay now shows:
- Loading indicator while generating the PageCard
- Success message when the PageCard is embedded
- No preview overlay that could clutter the interface

## How It Works Now

1. **Select text** → Overlay appears with "Edit" and "Explain" options
2. **Click "Explain"** → System generates PageCard content
3. **Content is embedded** → PageCard is inserted into markdown at the appropriate location
4. **Auto-save** → Changes are automatically saved to Firebase
5. **Live preview** → The embedded PageCard appears in the document immediately

## Testing

To test this system:
1. Navigate to any page with content
2. Select some text (like this paragraph)
3. Click "Explain" from the overlay
4. Watch the loading indicator
5. See the success message
6. Verify the PageCard appears in the document
7. Confirm changes are saved to Firebase

The system is now streamlined and focused on direct document editing with automatic persistence.
