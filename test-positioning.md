# Test Document for Text Selection

This is a test document to verify that PageCards are inserted right below selected text.

## First Section

This is some sample text that we can select to test the positioning. The PageCard should appear right after this sentence when we select it.

Here is another paragraph that follows the first one.

## Second Section

Another section with different content. We can select parts of this text to see how the PageCard insertion works.

### Subsection

Even more text to test with. This should help us verify that the PageCard positioning is working correctly.

## Testing Instructions

1. Select any text in this document
2. Click "Explain" from the overlay
3. Verify that the PageCard appears right after the selected text
4. The PageCard should not jump to section endings or other locations
5. It should maintain proper spacing and formatting

This system should now place PageCards exactly where users expect them - right after their selected text.
