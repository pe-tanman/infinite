## Current Status: âœ… COMPLETED & ENHANCED

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented and enhanced:
1. âœ… Multiple block selection with Ctrl/Cmd + Click
2. âœ… Double-click to edit blocks
3. âœ… Enhanced visual feedback and user experience
4. âœ… Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
5. âœ… Bulk operations toolbar
6. âœ… Help text and user guidance
7. âœ… **ENHANCED**: Robust scroll position preservation during edits
   - **Fixed**: Scroll restore attempts no longer point to position 0
   - **Enhanced**: Multi-method scroll position detection for cross-browser compatibility
   - **Improved**: Early scroll capture in TextSelectionOverlay before PageCard insertion
   - **Added**: Comprehensive debugging and logging for troubleshooting
   - **Result**: Users maintain their scroll position after any block edit, PageCard insertion, or content changeere not being detected properly in the block-based editor and were not rendering with proper styling
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced table detection logic in `BlockBasedEditor.tsx` to be more robust
  - Added `remark-gfm` plugin to all MDX serialization calls to enable GitHub Flavored Markdown table support
  - Improved table styling across all components with consistent, professional appearance
  - Added proper table wrapper with overflow handling and enhanced visual styling

### 2. PageCard Positioning After Editing - FIXED
- **Problem**: When using the text selection overlay to generate PageCards, incomplete PageCards were being added to the end of the document instead of at the correct position
- **Root Cause**: The PageCard MDX was wrapped in complex JSX that wasn't compatible with the markdown parser
- **Solution**: 
  - **Simplified PageCard MDX generation** - Removed complex wrapper div with className and JSX syntax
  - **Fixed table component mapping** - Added missing table component in BlockBasedEditor's MDXRemote components
  - **Improved content reconstruction** - Enhanced spacing logic for component blocks to preserve positioning

### 3. Multiple Block Selection and Double-Click Editing - NEW IMPROVEMENTS
- **Enhancement**: Added multiple block selection functionality and double-click editing
- **Features Added**:
  - **Multiple Selection**: Ctrl/Cmd + Click to select multiple blocks
  - **Double-Click Editing**: Double-click any block to start editing immediately
  - **Bulk Actions Toolbar**: Appears when multiple blocks are selected with options to Select All, Delete All, and Clear Selection
  - **Visual Indicators**: Enhanced selection styling with numbered indicators for multiple selections
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
    - Ctrl/Cmd + A: Select all blocks
    - Delete: Remove selected blocks
    - Escape: Clear selection
  - **Help Text**: Added comprehensive usage instructions at the bottom

### 4. Scroll Position Preservation - ENHANCED FIX (MDX Re-rendering Solution)
- **Problem**: Users were being scrolled back to the beginning of the page when saving block edits - scroll restore attempts always pointed at position 0
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Parent component was using `key={contentKey}` which forces complete re-render of BlockBasedEditor
  - MDX serialization process was causing scroll position to reset
  - Single scroll position detection (`window.scrollY`) wasn't reliable across all browsers and scenarios
- **Enhanced Solution**: 
  - **Robust Scroll Position Detection**: Uses multiple methods (`window.scrollY`, `window.pageYOffset`, `document.documentElement.scrollTop`) and takes the maximum value
  - **Early Scroll Capture**: TextSelectionOverlay now captures scroll position before triggering content changes
  - **Parent-Level Scroll Preservation**: Implemented scroll preservation at the parent component level to handle MDX re-rendering
  - **Session Storage Coordination**: Both parent and child components use coordinated session storage to preserve scroll position across component re-renders
  - **Multi-Strategy Approach**: Multiple timing strategies (0ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms, 500ms) to catch different rendering scenarios
  - **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive console logging to track scroll position capture and restoration
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Robust Detection**: `Math.max(window.scrollY, window.pageYOffset, document.documentElement.scrollTop)` ensures reliable scroll position capture
  - **Early Capture**: TextSelectionOverlay captures scroll position before PageCard insertion
  - **Parent Component**: Added `scrollPositionRef` and `preserveScrollRef` to track and restore scroll position
  - **Capture Before MDX**: Both `handleDocumentUpdate` and `handleSaveEdit` capture scroll position before MDX serialization
  - **Session Storage Backup**: Uses `pageScrollPosition` and `blockEditorScrollPosition` keys for persistence
  - **Multiple Restoration Attempts**: Uses both `setTimeout` with different delays and `requestAnimationFrame` for optimal timing
  - **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console output showing all scroll position values and restoration attempts
- **Result**: Robust scroll preservation that handles MDX re-rendering, component re-mounting, and various timing scenarios with reliable position detection

- **Multiple Selection**: State management changed from single `selectedBlockId` to array `selectedBlockIds`
- **User Experience**: Enhanced with visual feedback, keyboard shortcuts, and intuitive bulk operations
- **Scroll Preservation Architecture**: 
  - **Parent-Level Control**: Main scroll preservation logic moved to parent component to handle MDX re-rendering
  - **Session Storage Coordination**: Uses `pageScrollPosition` and `blockEditorScrollPosition` for cross-render persistence
  - **Timing Strategies**: Multiple restoration attempts (0ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms, 500ms) to handle various rendering scenarios
  - **MDX Re-rendering Solution**: Captures scroll position before MDX serialization and restores after component re-render
  - **Component Key Management**: Works with React's `key={contentKey}` forced re-renders while preserving scroll position

## Key Solution for PageCard Issue

The main fix was simplifying the PageCard MDX from:
```jsx
<div className="my-4 p-4 bg-blue-50...">
  <div className="text-sm...">
    ðŸ“š Learn more about: "..."
  </div>
  <PageCard ... />
</div>
```

To:
```jsx
<PageCard ... />
```

This eliminated complex JSX syntax that was incompatible with the markdown parser and causing the PageCard to be rendered incorrectly or positioned at the end of the document.
